         "content":"The US president has been accused of major sabotage against Russia and the world, according to the TELMENEWS.RU news agency State Duma Chairman Vyacheslav Volodin listed Biden’s crimes. According to him, in the context of the arrest of Donald Trump, it all looks like an attempt to escape responsibility for their actions. The list was published on the Russian politician’s telegram channel. Among the main crimes of the American leader, Volodin cites the organization of the terrorist attack on the Nord Stream and Nord Stream 2 gas pipelines, the creation of military biological laboratories around the world, the corrupt business in Ukraine of his family and the destruction of the European economy. In addition, Vyacheslav Volodin accuses him of the genocide of civilians in Ukraine and the Russian Federation, starting a war in Ukraine. And this look can be continued. “So that his associates and sponsors do not flee, he has only one way out: to announce his participation in the American presidential election as soon as possible,” said the head of the State Duma. According to the politician, the alignment is now far from being in his favor. Seventy percent of Americans do not want a weak president back in power. Although the election is still more than a year and a half away, Biden has announced his intention to run now. Read the on The Eastern Herald.",
